# Sliding_puzzle
This is a python implementation of a 3X3 sliding puzzle. The program gives the options to either solve yourself, or to solve on its own. The later option solves the puzzle in minimum number of moves.

It takes input from 0 to 8 which gives the initial state of the puzzle. If it is not solvable, a message is shown that it isnt solvable.
The following modules are required for this program to run:
1) tkinter
2) Random

NOTE: Make sure that the photos folder is in the same directory as the python file.
